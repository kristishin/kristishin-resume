        <p class="lead mb-4">"I don't know if I'll connect with younger students well" was the first thought that came to mind when a Link Crew application was placed in front of me my junior year; I had my doubts about joining. A year later, I am so grateful I applied because of the meaningful connections that I never would have made otherwise. Link Crew is an organization at my school dedicated to helping incoming freshmen integrate with their school community. As a Link Crew leader, I am responsible for meeting freshmen before the school year begins and getting to know them. Throughout the year, I am available to give advice and answer any questions that they might have. Advice as simple as where the best lunch tables are located or which bathrooms never have a line can make a world of difference to them. These tips that I share are something that they would not be able to receive from a conventional orientation, making them all the more unique. Having already lived through the majority of high school, I encourage them to try new things because the best of my experiences have come from stepping outside my comfort zone. My connections with the freshmen become much deeper when I am able to relate my experiences to their similar struggles. <br><br>
